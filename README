h2. About

Playground for collaborative filtering in Ruby using NArray and rb-gsl.

h2. Usage

Create a variable to store the ratings as an NArray (number of users x number of tracks).

Set the number of features to learn, lambda (regularization parameter), and the number of iterations of gradient descent.

Call min_cost

<pre>
ratings = NArray[[5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0],[3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],[4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],[3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],[3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]]
num_features = 2
lambda = 1
iterations = 10
cofi = CofiCost.new(ratings, num_features, lambda, iterations, nil, nil)
cofi.min_cost
</pre>

The cost and predictions (an NArray of the original size of ratings) can then be
returned after running min_cost:

<pre>
cofi.cost
cofi.predictions
</pre>

h2. Installation

h3. gem

rails 3.2
# gem 'cofi_cost'
in your Gemfile
# <pre>bundle install</pre> from the command line
